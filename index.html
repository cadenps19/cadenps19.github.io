        <p>Hello!  I am Jan Bloch, the author of Following Christ God’s Word:  Basic Truths and Guiding Principles.  Thank you for visiting my website today!<br><br>
            I deeply believe that God interacts with people and changes lives.  These truths were the basis of simple, non-threatening conversations I wanted to share with my children.  However, the circumstances of our lives allowed little time or opportunity for these conversations.  After several years of struggling with this concern, the Lord opened my eyes to the possibility of writing letters to my children.  This was the beginning of a journey in which I wrote many letters and my heart was filled with hope and peace.   <br><br>
            I never dreamed of being a writer, or a published author, still as the years passed, I discovered various studies sharing evidence that many people profess their faith in Christ but do not live their lives differently because of their faith.  Once again, I felt God calling me to publish my letters as they identify the basic beliefs of the Christian doctrine and how those beliefs impact daily life choices, one’s character, and healthy relationships.   By sharing these letters, I hope the reader will gain understanding of the basic concepts of scripture, discover clarity in life’s purpose, and learn to view the world with an eternal perspective and divine purpose.

        <h2>About the Book</h2>
        <img src="BookCover.jpeg" alt="Book Cover" class="book-cover">
        <div class="book-content">
        <p>This book began as a compilation of easily read and understood letters written to my two teenage children.  
            It is a guide to the fundamental truths and principles of The Holy Bible, our Lord’s guide to salvation and living life on earth.  
            The initial letters have been revised; however, the manuscripts still focus on understanding the value of faith, character, and relationships and how this information impacts one’s life and choices.  
            The materials may provide valuable tools for identifying and communicating the important concepts in developing a solid faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and living a purposeful life.  
            Although initially intended for teenagers, the content is helpful for all people confronted with important daily decisions and who want to feel the wonder of a life committed to God.  
            I hope that this book will allow the reader to discover a genuine faith and belief system, gain knowledge about how to simply live life in a more pleasing way to God, and find God’s love, salvation, peace, contentment, and purpose.  
            May God guide you on this journey as you allow him to make your life a blessing.  <br><br>
