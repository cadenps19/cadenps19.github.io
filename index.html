        <h2>Author Note</h2>
        <div class="author-content">
        <p>Hello!  I am Jan Bloch, the author of Following Christ God’s Word:  Basic Truths and Guiding Principles.  Thank you for visiting my website today!<br><br>
            I deeply believe that God interacts with people and changes lives.  These truths were the basis of simple, non-threatening conversations I wanted to share with my children.  However, the circumstances of our lives allowed little time or opportunity for these conversations.  After several years of struggling with this concern, the Lord opened my eyes to the possibility of writing letters to my children.  This was the beginning of a journey in which I wrote many letters and my heart was filled with hope and peace.   <br><br>
            I never dreamed of being a writer, or a published author, still as the years passed, I discovered various studies sharing evidence that many people profess their faith in Christ but do not live their lives differently because of their faith.  Once again, I felt God calling me to publish my letters as they identify the basic beliefs of the Christian doctrine and how those beliefs impact daily life choices, one’s character, and healthy relationships.   By sharing these letters, I hope the reader will gain understanding of the basic concepts of scripture, discover clarity in life’s purpose, and learn to view the world with an eternal perspective and divine purpose.
            </p>

        <h2>Presentation Summary:  Topics, Main Points, and Goal</h2>
        <div class="presentation-content">
        <p>My testimony is introduced by clarifying that, although I speak about my life, the story is not about me.  This story is about God’s care for me and my family during troubling times. The story begins during my young life and shares how it was fractured by a decade-long season of loss, sorrow, and great heartache.  However, my deepest concern during that time was that my children would come to know and love the Lord; our circumstances limited opportunities to talk and visit about God’s love. Only by God’s grace, were my children and I sustained.  After a decade of struggling with this concern, the Lord opened my eyes to the unexpected possibility of writing letters to my children.  For the next fifteen-plus-years, I wrote easy-to-understand letters to my children about the Christian doctrine and how to incorporate Christian beliefs into their daily living and life choices.<br><br>
             When my children grew into adulthood, God once again, opened my eyes to understand that many people acknowledge Him but fail to appreciate the significance of His being.  God led me to recognize that the individuals identified in these studies, would benefit from a straightforward book that clarifies the doctrine of the Christian faith.  Additionally, the book would explain how an individual’s faith would be a guide for establishing daily habits that honor God.  I quickly realized that was exactly what I shared with my children through letters, so I began to explore to possibility of compiling a book. My book, FOLLOWING CHRIST- Basic Truths and Guiding Principles was published in April 2024. <br><br>
             <p>Through my life story, I share how God demonstrates His love:</p>
<ul>
    <li>He knows all and is in control</li>
    <li>He is compassionate and is active in our world today</li>
    <li>We must be patient and wait for His timing</li>
    <li>He brings welcomed peace</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
             The program continues with a brief overview of the book which is divided into four sections with numerous chapters within each section.  Every chapter begins with a passage from scripture related to the topic.  The following is a list of sections, and chapters often presented during the speech.  The listing is not inclusive, nor is it guaranteed that each of these topics will be mentioned.<br><br>
             <ul>
    <li><strong>Understanding Your Faith:</strong> You Must Choose, Qualities of the Triune God (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), Evidence (Fulfilled Prophecies), Jesus’ Death and Ascension, and Hymns.</li>
    <li><strong>Living Your Faith:</strong> Jesus’ Passion, Peace/Control, Prayer, Your Calling, and God’s Opinion Matters.</li>
    <li><strong>Developing Godly Character:</strong> Self-worth, Power of the Tongue, Seek Wisdom, Set Boundaries/Courage, and Responsibilities (God, Community, Self).</li>
    <li><strong>Healthy Relationships:</strong> Qualities of Friends, Purpose/Who to Date, Marriage Considerations, and Family Traditions/Growing/Communication.</li>
</ul>

            <br><br>In closing, God wants to share in your journey, blessing each of you with His gifts in this life and the world to come. Only through Jesus Christ are you promised everlasting life with Him in heaven.  Make the choice today!  Shine brightly as you behave and speak in a manner that brings people to Christ, acknowledging that one’s actions may be the very tool God uses to draw others to Him.<br><br> By sharing my story, and a summary of various letters, I pray those in the audience will be blessed as they each journey to discover a genuine faith and belief system that will lead to trust in Jesus Christ as their Savior, and each will blessed by His gifts in this life and the world to come. Additionally, I hope each participant will be watchful and discover opportunities to serve Him in everyday life experiences.  Scripture tells us each to be a light to others in Matthew 5:14. “You are the light of the world.” <br><br>
            It would be my honor to meet with you and discuss the possibility of my witnessing to any group at your church, organization, or friendship circle. Audiences that might benefit from my experiences are parents of young children, women’s groups, grandparents, or any mature adult.  If you would like a list of references from previous speaking engagements, I am happy to provide those.  Thank you for your time and attention!  I look forward to hearing from you.<br><br>
            Grace to you and peace,<br>
            Jan Bloch

        <h2>About the Book</h2>
        <img src="BookCover.jpeg" alt="Book Cover" class="book-cover">
        <div class="book-content">
        <p>This book began as a compilation of easily read and understood letters written to my two teenage children.  
            It is a guide to the fundamental truths and principles of The Holy Bible, our Lord’s guide to salvation and living life on earth.  
            The initial letters have been revised; however, the manuscripts still focus on understanding the value of faith, character, and relationships and how this information impacts one’s life and choices.  
            The materials may provide valuable tools for identifying and communicating the important concepts in developing a solid faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and living a purposeful life.  
            Although initially intended for teenagers, the content is helpful for all people confronted with important daily decisions and who want to feel the wonder of a life committed to God.  
            I hope that this book will allow the reader to discover a genuine faith and belief system, gain knowledge about how to simply live life in a more pleasing way to God, and find God’s love, salvation, peace, contentment, and purpose.  
            May God guide you on this journey as you allow him to make your life a blessing.  <br><br>

        <div class="biography-content">
            <img src="JanAuthorPhoto.jpeg" alt="Author Photo" class="biography-photo"><br>
            <p>The most valued and treasured responsibilities I have held through life are being a wife, a mother, and a grandmother.  I am blessed to be married to a God-fearing, supportive, and delightfully kind man, Doug Bloch.  Additionally, it has been an honor being the mother to my 2 children, and my son-in-law.  Together, we enjoy a wide circle of family and friends who have brought great joy to our lives and for whom we are most grateful.  We strive to honor God by enjoying music, entertaining, dancing, traveling (especially to visit grandchildren), gardening, cooking, and teaching friends to play bridge.    Jan and Doug live in Springfield, Missouri.<br><br>
                My birth family gave me a spiritual heritage of love for God, family, and creation.  In addition, they reinforced the importance of compassion, integrity, persistence, and hard work.  We attended the Lutheran Church, where I was baptized and confirmed.  I cannot remember a time when I did not love the Lord.  However, through the years, I have grown and discovered a deeper understanding of how the Lord’s love for me impacts my life.  My family life is blessed with joyful times and happy memories.  There have, however, been many challenges.  Through each trial, it is apparent that the Lord was in the details as he provided sustenance, comfort, and strength.  As God promises, I believe he has used our misfortunes and tribulations to strengthen our faith and to further His kingdom.   <br><br>
                Professionally, I received a bachelor of fine arts degree in Vocational Education with an emphasis in family living and child development from Missouri State University (MSU).  I earned a master’s degree from Drury University in Springfield, Missouri, and later a specialist degree from MSU, both in educational administration.  My career began in public education as a Family and Consumer Science teacher.  Later, I was allowed to serve as an administrator in programs with children from kindergarten to 12th grade.  My vocation involved working closely with students, parents and faculty, businesses, and the community.  <br><br>
                Upon retirement in 2005, besides spending time with my family, three areas have filled my life and time.  First, I taught at the Ozark Technical Community College’s Middle College, which serves high school students whose life circumstances make its flexible, non-traditional environment more suitable to their needs.  Second, in 2005, I worked with a dear friend in Christ and a professional colleague, to organize and implement a Bible Study for working women called “God’s Lunch Bunch.”  This group met weekly, served lunch during the noon hour, and before the restrictions of the Covid pandemic, had a regular attendance of approximately 50 each week.  This group still exists today, fifteen-plus years later. Third, my husband Doug and I perform as vocalists and instrumentalists in a family-friendly, fun-filled, acoustic gospel music band called The Bridgetones.  The Bridgetones play at various venues including, community fairs and festivals, special-occasion parties, church socials, retirement communities, and assisted living homes. 
                In the future, I will continue to strive to serve my God each day and eagerly await the joys and challenges that He has in store.  When I meet my Lord at heaven’s gates, I pray He will say, “Well done, good and faithful servant.”
